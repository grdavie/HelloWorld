# Overview

This is my Personal Software Portfolio to showcase my projects as I learn new technologies and use it solve real-world problems. The first program I would like to share is the HelloWorld Program, an iconic and simple computer program that displays the mesage "Hello, world!" on the screen via the console. 

This program serves as an entry point for exploring any programming language. It provides hands-on experience with syntax, structure, and using an integrated development environment (IDE). Additionally, it ensures the IDE is properly set up for coding.

Beyond its simplicity, the HelloWorld Program represents the excitement of beginning a coding journey. By sharing this project, I aim to encourage others to embark on their own coding journeys, armed with the confidence to explore new technologies and solve problems.
