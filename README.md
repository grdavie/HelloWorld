# Overview

As an aspiring software engineer, this is my Personal Software Portfolio which contains all the software I have created in my effort to learn new technologies and solve new problems that I would like to share publicly. The first program I would like to share is the HelloWorld Program, an iconic and simple computer program that displays the mesage "Hello, world!" on the screen via the console. 

The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for exploring a chose programming language. It provides an initial hands-on experience with syntax and structure, and how to run a program in any chosen integrated development environment (IDE). It is a basic test to ensure that the IDE is set up properly and everything needed to create and run programs in the chosen computer language is configured correctly.

# Development Environment

* Python 3.11.5
* macOS Sonoma version 14.3.1 (23D60)
* Visual Studio Code version 1.87.0 (Universal) - including Python extension for VSCode

The programming language for this software is Python, an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Run the program in the Terminal.
